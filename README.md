 Analyzing the brightness of video frames displayed for autistic children
 </br></br>
 It is important that all frames of the video displayed to autistic children are almost the same brightness so that any changes in brightness will not cause their eyes to move.
 </br>

These scripts check the brightness of a video used for this purpose.
